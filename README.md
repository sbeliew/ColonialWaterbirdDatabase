Throughout the Americas, the destruction of freshwater wetlands, destruction and degradation of coastal and marine ecosystems, contaminants, sea level rise, and human disturbance influence waterbird populations. For some species, especially pelagic seabirds, these actions have resulted in declines in numbers; less often, they have resulted in waterbird species becoming nuisance wildlife. A critical element of conserving and managing waterbirds is a comprehensive monitoring program. Waterbird conservation planning and management decisions depend on measuring and evaluating population change as a basis for setting policy, identifying management and research priorities, and evaluating management actions
